            These raptors of sub-Saharan Africa's savannas, grasslands, and shrub lands stand at nearly four feet tall—and standing is often how you'll find them, because they primarily move around on foot. They fly only when necessary, such as to reach their nest in the trees and for courtship displays.<br>
            The secretary bird is distinguished by its long legs and a dramatic black crest of feathers on the back of its head. Its body is covered in whitish-gray feathers, with two long, black-tipped tail feathers. Its bare face is usually yellow, orange or red.<br>
             The top half of its long legs has black feathers, so it looks a bit like it's wearing bicycle shorts. The lower half is covered with scales and has barely visible feathers.<br>

            <strong>COMMON NAME:</strong> Shoebills<br>

            <strong> DIET:</strong>     Carnivore<br>
            <strong> GROUP NAME:</strong>  Flock<br>
            <strong>AVERAGE LIFE SPAN:</strong> 35 years<br>

            <img alt="" class="" data-mptype="image" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cadfccbf-ee61-4aa1-985e-b68198b4c078/shoebill-thumbnail-nationalgeographic_2176349_square.jpg?w=212.15999221801758&amp;h=212.15999221801758">

            Depending on your perspective, a shoebill either has the same goofy charm as the long-lost dodo or it looks like it might go on the attack any moment. What makes the aptly named shoebill so unique is its foot-long bill that resembles a Dutch clog.<br>
            Tan with brown splotches, it's five inches wide and has sharp edges and a sharp hook on the end. Its specialized bill allows the shoebill to grab large prey, including lungfish, tilapia, eels, and snakes. It even snacks on baby crocodiles and Nile monitor lizards.<br>
            
            At first glance, shoebills don't seem like they could be ambush predators. Reaching up to five feet tall with an eight-foot wingspan, shoebills have yellow eyes, gray feathers, white bellies, and a small feathered crest on the back of their heads.<br>
            They also have long, thin legs with large feet that are ideal for walking on the vegetation in the freshwater marshes and swamps they inhabit in East Africa, from Ethiopia and South Sudan to Zambia.<br>
