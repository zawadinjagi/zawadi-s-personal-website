        <h2>BIRDS AND FACTS</h2>
        <p> <strong>COMMON NAME:</strong> Secretary birds<br>
            <strong> SCIENTIFIC NAME:</strong> Sagittarius serpentarius<br>
            <strong> TYPE: </strong> Birds<br>
            <strong> DIET:</strong>     Carnivore<br>
            <strong> GROUP NAME:</strong>  Flock<br>
            <strong>AVERAGE LIFE SPAN:</strong>  Ten to 15 years<br>
            <strong>SIZE:</strong>  3.9 feet<br>
            <strong>WEIGHT:</strong>  5 to 9.4 pounds<br>


            <img alt="secretary birds" class="s-birds" data-mptype="image" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/d472dd3c-8d38-4eed-ae62-7472a12a17de/secretary-bird-thumbnail-nationalgeographic_2331336_square.jpg?w=212.15999221801758&amp;h=212.15999221801758">

            These raptors of sub-Saharan Africa's savannas, grasslands, and shrub lands stand at nearly four feet tall—and standing is often how you'll find them, because they primarily move around on foot. They fly only when necessary, such as to reach their nest in the trees and for courtship displays.<br>
            The secretary bird is distinguished by its long legs and a dramatic black crest of feathers on the back of its head. Its body is covered in whitish-gray feathers, with two long, black-tipped tail feathers. Its bare face is usually yellow, orange or red.<br>
             The top half of its long legs has black feathers, so it looks a bit like it's wearing bicycle shorts. The lower half is covered with scales and has barely visible feathers.<br>

            <strong>COMMON NAME:</strong> Shoebills<br>
            <strong> SCIENTIFIC NAME:</strong> Balaeniceps rex<br>
            <strong> TYPE: </strong> Birds<br>
            <strong> DIET:</strong>     Carnivore<br>
            <strong> GROUP NAME:</strong>  Flock<br>
            <strong>AVERAGE LIFE SPAN:</strong> 35 years<br>
            <strong>SIZE:</strong>  3.5 to 5 feet<br>
            <strong>WEIGHT:</strong> 11 pounds (females); 12 pounds (males)<br>
            <img alt="shoebill" class="shoebill" data-mptype="image" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/cadfccbf-ee61-4aa1-985e-b68198b4c078/shoebill-thumbnail-nationalgeographic_2176349_square.jpg?w=212.15999221801758&amp;h=212.15999221801758">

            Depending on your perspective, a shoebill either has the same goofy charm as the long-lost dodo or it looks like it might go on the attack any moment. What makes the aptly named shoebill so unique is its foot-long bill that resembles a Dutch clog.<br>
            Tan with brown splotches, it's five inches wide and has sharp edges and a sharp hook on the end. Its specialized bill allows the shoebill to grab large prey, including lungfish, tilapia, eels, and snakes. It even snacks on baby crocodiles and Nile monitor lizards.<br>
            
            At first glance, shoebills don't seem like they could be ambush predators. Reaching up to five feet tall with an eight-foot wingspan, shoebills have yellow eyes, gray feathers, white bellies, and a small feathered crest on the back of their heads.<br>
            They also have long, thin legs with large feet that are ideal for walking on the vegetation in the freshwater marshes and swamps they inhabit in East Africa, from Ethiopia and South Sudan to Zambia.<br>

              <strong>COMMON NAME:</strong> Horned screamers<br>
              <strong> SCIENTIFIC NAME:</strong> Anhima cornuta<br>
              <strong> TYPE:</strong> Birds<br>
              <strong> DIET:</strong> Herbivore<br>
              <strong>AVERAGE LIFE SPAN:</strong> Unknown<br>
              <strong>SIZE:</strong> About the size of a turkey<br>
              <strong>WEIGHT:</strong> Up to seven pounds<br>

              <img alt="h-screamer" class="h-screamer" data-mptype="image" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/1df11069-33e2-4f8c-92e4-00c1893a3771/horned-screamer-thumbnail-nationalgeographic_2678044_square.jpg?w=212.15999221801758&amp;h=212.15999221801758">

              Over the course of their lives, these birds grow long, white spines of cartilage in the middle of their foreheads. Some birds possess horns approaching six inches in length. No other birds on earth have anything like it.<br>

             Unlike with rams and rhinos, the screamer's horn doesn't seem to be a weapon, because it is only loosely attached to the skull and known to snap off once it grows too long. In time, broken horns even grow back. This leads scientists to believe the horns serve an ornamental purpose rather than a functional one.<br>

             While the horns are harmless, the screamers are not. Each bird sports a pair of sharpened bone spurs on its wings. These are used to defend territory and battle with each other for mates. After particularly nasty encounters, scientists have even found pieces of spur broken off and lodged in other birds' chest like shrapnel.<br>

          <strong>COMMON NAME:</strong> fairy penguin<br>
          <img alt="Fairy penguin (Eudyptula minor) colony making their way towards nesting burrows at night." class="fairy-penguin " data-testid="prism-image" draggable="false" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/56ee9eec-1967-4b31-8cdb-e1a57dfa68e9/1737823_3x2.jpg" style="object-position:left center">
          Little penguins, which are found across the southern coast of Australia and New Zealand, are not endangered, but at more than 40,000 breeding birds, the Phillip Island colony is the largest of all. Island ecosystems exist in a state of delicate equilibrium, and it takes only one small change for that harmony to collapse.<br>
          The Penguin Parade—where thousands of little penguins emerge from the ocean like clockwork at sunset to return to their burrows on Phillip Island, a mere 80-mile drive from Melbourne—is one of Australia's star tourist attractions.<br>

         Given the popularity of the nightly march, I was worried about a theme-park vibe. But when I saw the first group of penguins come waddling out of the ocean, determined and adorable, I drew a giddy breath. It was just plain awesome.<br>

          <strong>COMMON NAME:</strong> Barn owl<br>
          <strong>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</strong> Tyto alba<br>
          <strong>TYPE:</strong> Birds<br>
          <strong>DIET:</strong> Carnivore<br>
          <strong>AVERAGE LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD:</strong> 4 years<br>
          <strong>SIZE:</strong> About a foot<br>
          <strong>WEIGHT:</strong> About a pound<br>
          <img alt="barn-owl" class="barn-owl" data-mptype="image" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/a92eefb1-8250-4b2b-b88e-9a7611775566/barn-owl_square.jpg?w=212.15999221801758&amp;h=212.15999221801758">
          With its banshee call, dark eyes, and bright white face, a barn owl could pass for a winged ghost, moving silently against the night sky.<br>

          In fact, many cultures associate the barn owl with superstition. In England, where barn owls often live in graveyards, one of these birds flying by the window of an invalid symbolizes approaching death. The Zapotec people of Mexico also saw the barn owl as a fatal omen, and the ancient Egyptians believed barn owls occupied “the realm of death,” likely due to their nocturnal habits.<br>

          But it's also true that barn owls are a boon to their ecosystems, preying on agricultural pests such as rats and mice. They're one of the most widespread bird species on Earth, with 10 subspecies inhabiting every continent except Antarctica.<br>

          Barn owls don't migrate, instead thriving year-round in numerous environments, including open lowlands, farmlands, and deserts. True to their name, barn owls may use isolated buildings for daytime roosts, and are at home living among people in cities and suburbs.<br>

          <strong>COMMON NAME:</strong> Partridges.<br>
          <strong>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</strong> Phasianidae.<br>
          <strong>DIET:</strong> Omnivore.<br>
          <strong>AVERAGE LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD:</strong> 3 years.<br>
          <strong>SIZE:</strong> Around a foot long.<br>
          <strong>WEIGHT:</strong> About a pound.<br>
          <img alt="Partridges" class="Partridges" data-mptype="image" src="https://i.natgeofe.com/n/31a0f5f4-0fda-491e-a3da-7b53fd64d021/red-legged-partridges_square.jpg?w=212.15999221801758&amp;h=212.15999221801758">
          Plump, midsize birds with curved bills, partridges live in a variety of habitats around the world, including forests, grasslands, and rocky plains..<br>

         Despite what you may have heard about pear trees, the 56 partridge species are ground-dwellers, using their short, sturdy legs and strong claws to dig for food or make nests. These pheasant relatives generally run quickly, though they will burst into flight if danger looms..<br>

         Adults eat seeds, leaves, and invertebrates, while chicks feed mostly on insects. Some species, such as the gray partridge and the chukar, eat only plants..<br>
